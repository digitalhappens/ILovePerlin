# ILovePerlin
A VCV Rack plugin for producing noises / chaotic (modulation-)signals with perlin noise

At the moment this set contains only one module: PerlinOne

PerlinOne is taken from / totally based on [NauModulars Perlin]https://github.com/naus3a/NauModular. Because there is no updated version of his modules to VCV Rack 1.0 standard, I decided to port this from 0.6 to 1.0.

In the future there will be more modules in ILovePerlin which will do "something" based on [perlin noise]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise.
