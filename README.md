# ILovePerlin
A VCV Rack plugin for producing noises / chaotic (modulation-)signals with perlin noise

At the moment this set contains only one module: PerlinOne

PerlinOne is taken from / totally based on [NauModulars Perlin](https://github.com/naus3a/NauModular). Because there is no updated version of his modules to VCV Rack 1.0 standard, I decided to port this usefull module from 0.6 to 1.0.

In the future there will be more modules in ILovePerlin which will do "something" based on [perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise).

*PerinOne*

"The speed knob controls how much nervous the noise is. On its side you have a CV control input and a smaller knob to balance the final speed between the main knob's value and the CV input.
The amp knob controls noise amplitude. On its side threre's a CV control input and a balancing knob, just like for the speed control.
The lower 4 knobs are a frequency mixer: the module constantly calculates 4 noise octaves and each of these knobs controls how much of a specific octaves goes into the final mix.
The 4 outputs positioned in a square shape are single octave outputs; they are in the same order as the frequency mixer knobs: the top left one outputs the slowest noise, the bottom right one outputs the fastest noise.
The lowest, central output is the mix output, giving you a mix of the noise octaves based on your frequency mixer settings."
